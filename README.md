# MC_shiftlight
this is my first attempt to program a micro controller. And of course i need a goal. A simple shift light to be attached on my motorcycle. I have seen some projects i like, but they are far more than i need. This is going to be a Neopixel strip acting like a gauge and at a predefined RPM the strip will be flashing for gear change.
